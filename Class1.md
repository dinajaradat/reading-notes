# Pain and Suffering

### Challenge:  debugging errors
### Strategy:  use print statements to identify where the error is occurring and  use a debugging tool 

### Challenge: difficult to understand the syntax of a programming language 
### Strategy: Practice writing code and experimenting with different syntax

# Big O
### Time complexity: the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to execute.
### Space complexity: the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute.

# Names and Values in Python

| Mutable | Immutable |
| --- | ----------- |

| Can be modified in place without creating a new object | Cannot be modified in place; a new object must be created with the desired value |
| Lists, Dictionaries, Sets| integers, Booleans, Strings ,Float|
