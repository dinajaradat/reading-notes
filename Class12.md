### Pandas is a popular open-source data manipulation library for Python that is built on top of the NumPy library.
### NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column.

## What are the primary data structures in Pandas, and how do they differ in terms of use cases?

### The primary data structures in Pandas are Series and DataFrame. 

### A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type such as integers, strings, or floating-point numbers. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet.

### A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure that consists of rows and columns, where each column can be a different data type. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Series objects that share the same index.
