## Caesar cipher
### is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

### A symmetric encryption is any technique where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest symmetric encryption techniques, and of course, one of the easiest to crack.
        Original	V	E	R	S	A	I	L	L	E	S
        Shift key	C	H	E	E	S	E	C	H	E	E

        Encrypted	N	V	Y	Z	J	I
        Shift key	C	H	E	E	S	E


## Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
### encrypting data means that we scramble the original data to hide the meaning of the text, while still making it possible for the data to be unscrambled using a secret key.
