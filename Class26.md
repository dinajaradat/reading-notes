## What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?
### Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to streamline web development. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive set of small, atomic utility classes that can be directly applied in HTML markup, allowing developers to style elements efficiently without writing custom CSS. With Tailwind CSS, developers can rapidly prototype and build custom designs by combining and configuring these utility classes. 

### Bootstrap CSS is a comprehensive CSS framework that offers a pre-built set of components, styles, and layout options. It follows a component-centric approach, providing ready-to-use classes and components for consistent and responsive designs. Unlike Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap CSS offers a more opinionated design system with a collection of pre-defined components, making it easier to create consistent designs and prototypes.
