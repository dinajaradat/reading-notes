# SQL
### Relational databases are a way of organizing data into tables, and SQL is a language used to manage data. Together, they allow users to efficiently store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data in a structured manner.
###  I learned how to insert, delete, and update rows within a database. select and joins across multiple tables. Additionally,  create and drop tables.

## DROP TABLE
### command that allows you to remove a table from a database.

## UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE/CREATE
### CREATE:  command used to create new database objects
### INSERT:  command used to add new data to a table
### UPDATE:  command used to modify existing data in a table, specifies the table name, the columns to be updated, and the new values for those columns.
### DELETE: command used to remove data from a table, specifies the table name and the conditions that must be met for the rows to be deleted.

## ADD ROW/COLUMN
### ADD ROW and ADD COLUMN are SQL keywords used in the ALTER TABLE statement to add new rows or columns to an existing table.

## ORDER BY
### command is useful when you want to sort the results of a query based on one or more columns.

## ASC/DESC
###  ASC/DESC are two keywords used in SQL to specify the sorting order of a result set.
### ASC stands for "Ascending" and it is used to sort the result set in ascending order
### DESC stands for "Descending" and it is used to sort the result set in descending order

## LIMIT/OFFSET
### used in SELECT statements to limit the number of rows returned by a query and to skip a specified number of rows
### The LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of rows to be returned by a query. 
### The OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before returning the results.
