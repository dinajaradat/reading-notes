# TDD
## To use TDD with python, follow the following process
### 1- Write tests first to define the expected behavior of the code
### 2- Keep tests simple and focused on one aspect of functionality at a time
### 3- Write code only to pass failing tests
### 4- Refactor code to keep it maintainable, flexible
### 5- Run all of the tests

# if __name__ == '__main__':
### used to create code that can be run as a standalone program or as a module imported into another program

# Recursion
### it is a technique where a function calls itself during its execution to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems,the function will solve the subproblem and return the result

# Python modules and packages
### module: is a single file that can be imported and used directly
### package:  is collections of related modules that need to be imported first before their modules can be used
