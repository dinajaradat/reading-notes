### An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

      Depth First
      Breadth First
### Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
### Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

        Pre-order: root >> left >> right
        In-order: left >> root >> right
        Post-order: left >> right >> root
### Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 

## Binary Search Trees
### (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
