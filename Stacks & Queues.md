## Stacks and Queues
### A stack (First In Last Out) is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Common terminology for a stack is

          Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
          Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. 
          Top - This is the top of the stack.
          Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack
          IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### A queue (First In First Out) is a data structure that represents a collection of elements where the insertion and removal of elements are performed in a specific order. Elements are added at one end, which is known as the rear or tail, and removed from the other end, known as the front or head.
        
### Common terminology for a queue is

          Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
          Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue
          Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
          Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
          Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue.
          IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
