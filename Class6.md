## Random module is a built-in module in Python that provides a set of functions for generating random data.
## The Random module contains some very useful functions namely randint() function, random() function, choice() function, randrange() function and shuffle() function.

## Test coverage
### a high level of coverage does not necessarily ensure that tests are sufficient or of high quality. The sufficiency of testing depends on factors such as the rarity of bugs in production and the ease of making changes to the code without causing new bugs.


## How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

### select a random element from a list  by passing the list names to the choice() function as input 
    import random
    myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
    random.choice(myList)

## some other common functions available within the module:
### randrange() , shuffle() , random() , randint()

## risk analysis
### is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

## what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

### Searching the risk
### Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
### Measures for the risk identified

## What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm?
### mathematical notation used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.
### determine the worst-case scenario for the algorithm's runtime and express it in terms of Big O notation
