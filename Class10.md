## JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

###  Jupyter Lab provides a more flexible and powerful environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. Jupyter Lab's multi-document interface, advanced code editing features, and integrated terminal make it more suitable for advanced users. 

### Jupyter Notebook is still a widely used and valuable tool for basic data analysis and visualization tasks and is still supported by the Jupyter project.

## NumPy which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
## the key features of NumPy:

### NumPy Array Operations :NumPy makes it simple to perform mathematical operations on arrays. This is one of the primary advantages of NumPy, and makes it quite easy to do computations. 
### Broadcasting : Unless the arrays that you're operating on are the exact same size, it's not possible to do elementwise operations. In cases like this, NumPy performs broadcasting to try to match up elements
### Dimensional NumPy Arrays :  NumPy provides a powerful N-dimensional array object that can be used to store and manipulate large arrays of data efficiently.
### NumPy Array Comparisons : NumPy makes it possible to test to see if rows match certain values using mathematical comparison operations like <, >, >=, <=, and ==.
