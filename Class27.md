## Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?
### Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. The definition of the model is independent of the underlying database

###  Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one (OneToOneField), one to many (ForeignKey) and many to many (ManyToManyField).

## the key components and workflow of a Django application are outlined as follows:
### Models : Models represent the data structure and define the database schema for your application. 
### Views : Views handle the logic of your application. They receive requests from users, retrieve data from models or other sources, and render responses.
### Forms : hey are responsible for rendering HTML form elements and handling user-submitted data.
### Templates : Templates are used to generate the HTML content that is sent back to the user's browser
### URLs : to specific views in your application. 

## the workflow of a Django application can be described as:
### User makes a request to a specific URL.
### The URL is matched to a view.
### The view processes the request, interacts with models, and retrieves or modifies data.
### The view passes the data to a template.
### The template generates HTML content with the provided data.
### The HTML response is sent back to the user's browser.
### The browser displays the web page to the user.
