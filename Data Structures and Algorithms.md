## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
### requirements of the problem( type of data to be stored, the number of elements to be stored )
### Operations to be performed (  insertion, deletion, search, and traversal)
### time and space complexity

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
### Set a base case that will stop the recursion
### Ensure that the input is reduced in each recursive call
