## What is Big O notation and how is it used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function?
### is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function by evaluatingits running time or memory space complexity.It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm or function.

### the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space
## What is Constant Complexity?
### means that the algorithm always uses the same amount of time or space, regardless of the input size

## What is Logarithmic Complexity?
 ### means that as the input size increases, the growth rate of the algorithm slows down. Logarithmic complexity is more efficient than linear and quadratic complexity but less efficient than constant complexity.
 ### It is commonly seen in algorithms that involve binary search or divide-and-conquer techniques.

## What is  Linear Complexity?
### represented by the notation O(n), where n is the size of the input. An example of an algorithm with linear complexity would be one that iterates through each element of an array and performs a constant number of operations on each element

## What is a Linked List?
### A Linked List is a sequence of elements called nodes,Each node in a linked list contains two fields: a data field that stores the actual element or value, and a pointer field that points to the next node in the list.
### The first node in a linked list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. Linked lists can be singly linked, where each node points to the next node, or doubly linked, where each node points to both the next and the previous nodes in the list.
