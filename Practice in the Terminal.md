## The Command Line
### command line is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with your computer's operating system using commands. It works by interpreting the commands you type in and executing the corresponding actions

## Manual Pages 
### The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept

### In addition to that, you can utilize the man -k <search term> command to perform a keyword search for all manual pages that contain the provided search term. For instance, running man -k network will display a list of all manual pages that contain the keyword "network".

### Finally, when you search for a term within a manual page using the /<term> command, you can cycle through each instance of the term within the page by using the n command. For example, after searching for "sort" using the /sort command, you can press the n key to move to the next occurrence of the term within the page.
